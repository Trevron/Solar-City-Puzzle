# Solar-City-Puzzle
Match-3 Puzzle / City Management Game

You can play it <a href="https://trevron.itch.io/solar-city-puzzle">here</a>!

Complete match-3 style puzzles to rehabilitate a broken and desolate landscape and turn it into a Solarpunk utopia!

Directions:
- Click the puzzle piece icon to open and close the puzzle.
- Hover over landmarks to see upgrade requirements.
- The puzzle will reset/randomize on each open.
- As resources are gained/lost the landscape will change.

Note: The hourglass piece represents time and you do not gain resources for clearing them. Time is merely an obstacle to future progress.

Art, programming, music, and sound effects were created by me.
